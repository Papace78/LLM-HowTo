# ðŸ¤– AI Agent

This folder shows how to build an **AI Agent** using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), a framework built on top of LangChain.

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s an Agent?

Unlike a regular LLM that just answers your prompt, an **agent** can:
- **Choose tools** to call based on your request
- **Run those tools automatically**
- **Use memory** to follow up over multiple steps
- **Decide what to do next**

You just ask in natural language, and the agent handles the logic, calls APIs, gathers info, and returns results â€” step by step.

## ðŸš€ What can this one do?

This agent can:
- Get stock prices using the Polygon API
- Search Wikipedia

Itâ€™s like a smart assistant that *thinks*, *decides*, and *acts* â€” not just replies.
